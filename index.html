<p> Try to guess the letter that the computer has selected. You can guess any letter in the alphabet. You have 9 guesses before you take a lose. </p>


<p id="userGuess"> What letter do you guess? </p>
<p id="wins"> Wins: </p>
<p id="losses"> Losses: </p>
<p id="guessesLeft"> Amount of guesses left: </p>
<p id="alreadyGuessed"> What letters you have already guessed: </p>





<!-- <p id= "playerGuess" ></p>

<p id= "wins" ></p> 

<p id= "losses" ></p> 

<p id="guessesLeft" ></p> Need to get this to refresh once the correct letter is guessed

<p id="alreadyGuessed"> </p> (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)

8. When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).

9. When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins). -->
